This mod is an add-on for the [Import Skeleton Warrior](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/grimrock-import/tree/master/import_skeletonWarrior) mod. It adds a version of the Skeleton Warrior that is weak to shock, as is in-keeping with most undead enemies in Grimrock 2.

To install this add-on you must first follow the installation instructions for the Import Skeleton Warrior mod, found in its respective README.

Once that mod is installed, download this folder. Copy the contents of the "import_skeletonWarrior_WS" folder into the "import_skeletonWarrior" folder in your main "mod_assets" folder, overwriting any files when prompted. The add-on has now been installed.
